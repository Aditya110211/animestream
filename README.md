## Tech Stack

Built with ❤️ using Flutter

## Introduction

**animestream** is a project made to stream and download Anime. Inspired from parent project [animestream-electron](https://github.com/frostnova721/animestream-electron) which was limited to desktops. Just wanted to make an app! btw, this app is **HEAVILY** inspired from saikou (you know what it means!)

## Installation

You can download the latest apk file from the [releases](https://github.com/frostnova721/animestream/releases) tab. Then install the downloaded apk!

## Available Sources

Currently, you can enjoy anime content from the following sources:

- **Gogo**
- **Ryuk**

## Known Issues

As of now, I haven't encountered any issues while testing. If you are having issues, open a issue!

## Building

To build the apk from the source code, simply run the command below:

```
flutter build apk
```

PS: Your machine needs to have flutter installed. [Install flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
