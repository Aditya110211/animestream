## Tech Stack

Built with ❤️ using Flutter

## Introduction

**animestream** is a project made to stream and download Anime. Inspired from parent project [animestream-electron](https://github.com/frostnova721/animestream-electron) which was limited to desktops. Just wanted to make an app! btw, this app is **HEAVILY** inspired from saikou (you know what it means!)

## Installation

You can download the latest apk file from the [releases](https://github.com/frostnova721/animestream/releases) tab. Then install the downloaded apk!

## Known Issues

- Some files not downloading properly (fixes incoming!)

## Building

- Clone the repo

- Install required packages:

```cmd
flutter pub get
```

- Setup signing keystore file for android and store them in `android/app/` directory

- Setup key.properties in `android/` directory

- To build the apk from the source code, simply run the command below:

```cmd
flutter build apk
```

- To build application for windows, run the following command:

```cmd
flutter build windows
```

- To package the windows application as a setup, run:

```cmd
dart run inno_bundle:build --release
```

PS: Your machine needs to have flutter installed. [Install flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
