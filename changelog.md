**Yep! That's it.**

I fr forgot to track the changes, so there are changes in the app which arent mentioned above!
Plugins has to wait :)

Spent an awful lot of time on plugins. And yes, it didnt work out like I expected. It did work,
just not according to my style and expectations! So, this is a small bug sqash update!

If you are still encountering the white/gray screen issue or any other issues, submit it on github issues, discord or reddit.

As always, love y'all and Until Next Version, <br>
**Cya!**
