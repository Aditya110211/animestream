# Changelog 1.3.7 -> 1.4.0

**v1.4.0 update (part 1)**

## What's new?

## Fixes

- Fixed downloads stuck at 100% without showing a completion message
- Fixed multiple dead providers
- Fixed faulty downloads / low sized downloads (not 100% btw)
- Fixed #22, dubs not being selected while using navigation from watch page.
- Fixed subtitles showing random unreadable characters.
- Fixed subtitle's custom styling resetting to default while dubs/episode list's view mode are toggled
- There sure are some more fixes, forgot to keep track of all

Okay, That wraps up this patch: part 1 of v1.4.0, This is unpolished, and I expect to find some bugs, part 2 is planned to feature the player improvements (hehe) and based on it, with added further refinements to the downloader.

Well, the old downloader was scrapped in favour of a new Download Manager, imo the code is clean!
I dont expect it to be bug/error proof, but will be fixed along the way if issues are found out!

Alright alright, not yapping too much! <br>
**As always, Thanks for the love and support <3**

see yall with the part 2!
